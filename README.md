# Dotfiles

Contains system and tool configuration. This README intentionally left bare,

See `diff.sh` for path conversion to system paths.

See `setup.sh` for an in-progress, very thorough, MacOS setup script.

See `bin/` for small useful programs I wrote.

See each tool directory for tool configuration.
